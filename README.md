# Noughts & Crosses

__Set-up:__
* Create a project on Google Cloud Platform
* Register a number on Twilio for SMS
* Create a cloud function with a HTTP trigger and insert the code from `twilio-listener.py`, and use this as the webhook for the SMS responses
* Create a cloud storage bucket called `sms-noughts-and-crosses` and insert within it the `game.json` file from the repository

After doing all of this you should be good to go!
